Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables.
Eg- int char double

Derived Data Types: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types.
Eg- function array


Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure
Eg- class structure

Local Variables
Global Variables

Variable scope in C++

Now let’s understand each of the scope at a greater detail:


Local Variables
Variables defined within a function or block are said to be local to those functions. 



Anything between ‘{‘ and ‘}’ is said to inside a block.
Local variables do not exist outside the block in which they are declared, i.e. they can not be accessed or used outside that block.



As the name suggests, Global Variables can be accessed from any part of the program.

They are available through out the life time of a program.
They are declared at the top of the program outside all of the functions or blocks.
Declaring global variables: Global variables are usually declared outside of all of the functions and blocks, at the top of the program. They can be accessed from any portion of the program.

Integer : stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
size - 2 or 4 bytes

Boolean - stores either true or false

char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
size - 1 byte

string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes

Float - Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits
size - 4 bytes
